## 🛠️ **Solution Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Netlify**

1. **Go to your Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/
   - Select your `brainly-frontend` site

2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**
   - Go to `Site Settings` → `Environment Variables`
   - Or `Build & Deploy` → `Environment Variables`

3. **Add the following variables:**
   ```
   Key: VITE_BACKEND_URL
   Value: https://web-production-69a9.up.railway.app/api/v1
   
   Key: VITE_APP_NAME  
   Value: Brainely
   
   Key: VITE_APP_VERSION
   Value: 1.0.0
   
   Key: VITE_DEV_MODE
   Value: false
   ```

### **Step 2: Trigger a New Deployment**

1. **Option A: Redeploy from Dashboard**
   - In Netlify Dashboard → `Deploys` tab
   - Click `Trigger deploy` → `Deploy site`

2. **Option B: Git Push (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Add environment variables and improve error handling"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Step 3: Verify the Fix**

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open your site: https://brainly-frontend.netlify.app/
   - Press `F12` → `Console` tab
   - Look for: `✅ Backend URL is valid`
   - You should see the correct backend URL logged

2. **Test Signup**
   - Go to signup page
   - Enter test credentials
   - Check console for detailed debug logs

## 🔮 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### **Console Logs (Success)**

---

## 🆘 **If Problem Persists**

### **Check These Items:**

1. **Environment Variables Set?**
   - Verify in Netlify Dashboard → Environment Variables
   - Must start with `VITE_` prefix

2. **New Deployment Triggered?**  
   - Check timestamp in Netlify → Deploys
   - Should be after adding environment variables

3. **Browser Cache Cleared?**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`
   - Or open in incognito/private window

4. **Console Showing Correct URL?**
   - Should log: `📡 Backend URL: https://web-production-69a9.up.railway.app/api/v1`
   - If showing localhost, environment variables not set properly

### **Alternative Debugging Steps:**

1. **Test the backend directly:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://web-production-69a9.up.railway.app/api/v1/signup \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"username":"testuser123","password":"testpass123"}'
   ```

2. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Try signup, check the failed request
   - Look for CORS errors or 404s

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Environment Variables Must Start with `VITE_`**
   - This is a Vite requirement for client-side access
   - `BACKEND_URL` won't work, must be `VITE_BACKEND_URL`

2. **Case Sensitivity Matters**
   - Use exact variable names as shown above

3. **No Quotes Needed**
   - In Netlify dashboard, just paste the URL without quotes

4. **Deploy After Changes**
   - Environment variable changes require a new deployment
